<p>Mass customization supports the creation of personalized products that fulfill the features desired by specific
customers. In this context, variability models are used to specify which configurable features are supported and what 
constraints among the features must be satisfied to guarantee the validity of the derived products. Features in a 
variability model have usually varying degrees of importance. Some features may be highly demanded by the market and so 
most derivatives should include them. Other features may become dispensable as the market demand evolves. In addition, 
there may be features that indirectly become of key importance because other essential features need them, or features 
that cannot be included in any derivative due to their incompatibility with highly required features.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objetives</h3>

<p>Our objetive is to provide a faster algorithm, which identifies dead and core features using BDDs. In addition, since 
more complex logics than the Propositional one, which include integer arithmetic, transitive closure, etc., can be 
reduced to Boolean functions, and thus encoded as BDDs, our algorithm is general enough to support most variability 
model notations.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Method</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
