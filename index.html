<p>Mass customization supports the creation of personalized products that fulfill the features desired by specific
customers. In this context, variability models are used to specify which configurable features are supported and what 
constraints among the features must be satisfied to guarantee the validity of the derived products. Features in a 
variability model have usually varying degrees of importance. Some features may be highly demanded by the market and so 
most derivatives should include them. Other features may become dispensable as the market demand evolves. In addition, 
there may be features that indirectly become of key importance because other essential features need them, or features 
that cannot be included in any derivative due to their incompatibility with highly required features.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objetives</h3>

<p>Our objetive is to provide a faster algorithm, which identifies dead and core features using BDDs. In addition, since 
more complex logics than the Propositional one, which include integer arithmetic, transitive closure, etc., can be 
reduced to Boolean functions, and thus encoded as BDDs, our algorithm is general enough to support most variability 
model notations.</p>

<a id="conclusions" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusions</h3>

<p>On one hand existing approaches to identify core and dead features in variability models rely on the use of logic engines as
“black boxes”. They follow the strategy of repeatedly calling predefined functions in the engines (one call for each feature
to force its presence in the Boolean formula that encodes the variability model). We have shown that such strategy has poor
time performance and so it hinders user interactivity. The algorithm provides in this repository directly interacts with the 
data structure of the BDD that encodes a variability model. By efficiently traversing the BDD, it has been shown, both 
theoretically and experimentally, that our algorithm exhibits better time-performance than related work.
