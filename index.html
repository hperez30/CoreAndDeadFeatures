<p>Mass customization supports the creation of personalized products that fulfill the features desired by specific
customers. In this context, variability models are used to specify which configurable features are supported and what 
constraints among the features must be satisfied to guarantee the validity of the derived products. Features in a 
variability model have usually varying degrees of importance. Some features may be highly demanded by the market and so 
most derivatives should include them. Other features may become dispensable as the market demand evolves. In addition, 
there may be features that indirectly become of key importance because other essential features need them, or features 
that cannot be included in any derivative due to their incompatibility with highly required features.

In this project we provide an efficient algorithm to identify core and dead features in Varibility Models. The implementation encode 
configurations in binary and uses reduced ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) to represent and reason about large 
variblity models. Our algorithm utilizes the BuDDy BDD package for handling BDDs, however it is easy to get an equivalent 
implementation to work on other BDD package, for instance <a href="http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/">CUDD package</a>. </p>

<a id="install" class="anchor" href="#install" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick install</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/buddy/">buddy-2.4.tar.gz</a> (766,5 kB).
  <li> Unzip "gunzip buddy-2.4.tar.gz".
  <li> Untar "tar xvf buddy-2.4.tar".
  <li> Test: go to "CLab10/example/shirt" and compile the source files of the example by running "make". This should 
       produce the executable "shirt". The effect of running "shirt" should be an assignment of color to Black, 
       print to MIB, and size to Small.
